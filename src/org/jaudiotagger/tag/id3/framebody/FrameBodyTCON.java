 * ID3V23:References to the ID3v1 genres can be made by, as first byte, enter
 * "(" followed by a number from the genres list (appendix A) and
 * ended with a ")" character. This is optionally followed by a
 * refinement, e.g. "(21)" or "(4)Eurodisco". Several references can be
 * made in the same frame, e.g. "(51)(39)". If the refinement should
 * begin with a "(" character it should be replaced with "((", e.g. "((I
 * can figure out any genre)" or "(55)((I think...)". The following new
 * content types is defined in ID3v2 and is implemented in the same way
 * as the numeric content types, e.g. "(RX)".

 * ID3V24:The 'Content type', which ID3v1 was stored as a one byte numeric
 * value only, is now a string. You may use one or several of the ID3v1
