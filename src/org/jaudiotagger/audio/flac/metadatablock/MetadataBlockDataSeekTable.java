/**
 * SeekTable Block
 *
 * <p>This is an optional block for storing seek points. It is possible to seek to any given sample in a FLAC stream
 * without a seek table, but the delay can be unpredictable since the bitrate may vary widely within a stream.
 * By adding seek points to a stream, this delay can be significantly reduced. Each seek point takes 18 bytes, so 1%
 * resolution within a stream adds less than 2k. There can be only one SEEKTABLE in a stream, but the table can have
 * any number of seek points. There is also a special 'placeholder' seekpoint which will be ignored by decoders but
 * which can be used to reserve space for future seek point insertion.
