	  <h1>Keep On Top</h1>
	  When selected, the <b>Tools|Keep Window On Top</b> menu item
	  will float the <i>Checker</i> window above other windows on your
	  desktop. Even if you activate a window that is obscured by the
	  <i>Checker</i> window, it won't cover up <i>Checker</i>.
	  This can be handy when dragging and dropping files to check.

	  <p><b>Note:</b> Some platforms may not support this feature, in which
	  case this menu item will not be shown.
