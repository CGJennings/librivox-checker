	  <h1>Clipping</h1>
	  Clipping is a kind of audio distortion. It can occur if your
	  recording input level is too high, or if you amplify the audio
	  too much in your editing software.

	  <p>In your computer, audio is represented using a sequence of numbers.
	  Each number represents the amplitude of the audio's sound wave for
	  a tiny moment in time. Each of these numbers has a limited range
	  of values. Clipping occurs when the wave's amplitude (height) is too large
	  to fit in this limited range of numbers. If you look at a
	  <a href="waveform.html">picture of the waveform</a>,
	  clipping appears as straight lines along the top
	  or bottom of the graph. The clipped parts of the audio sound distorted
	  because the information about the shape of the sound wave that falls
	  outside of the available number range is missing.

	  <p><i>Checker</i> tests for clipping by looking for these straight lines
	  in the shape of the waveform. It reports how much of the audio appears
	  to be clipped on the <b>Information</b> tab. If the amount of clipping
	  exceeds a certain threshold, it will be listed as an issue in the validation
	  report. If the clipping was introduced while you were editing the file,
	  you may be able to go back to an older version of the file, if you have
	  one available. If the clipping occurred during recording, the only way to
	  fix it is to do the recording over.
