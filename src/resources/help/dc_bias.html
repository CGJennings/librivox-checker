	  <h1>DC Bias</h1>
	  DC bias occurs when the <a href="waveform.html">shape of an audio waveform</a>
	  is not centered, so that the height of the empty space above the top of the
	  waveform is not the same as the height of the empty space below the waveform.

	  <p>It is good practice to remove any DC bias as a first step when
	  you start editing.
	  Although DC bias is not a problem on its own, it can become a problem
	  during editing. For example, audio with a DC bias becomes
	  <a href="clipping.html">clipped</a> more readily than audio without.
