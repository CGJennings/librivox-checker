	  <h1>Quick Start Guide</h1>
	    <i>Checker</i> finds many common problems with <i>LibriVox</i> MP3 files
		before you make the effort of uploading them.
		Fixing these problems early will save time in the long run, both for you
		and for the project's coordinators. It can also help to create a higher
		quality experience for your listeners.
	  <h1>Checking Files</h1>
	    To check a file, you can drag-and-drop it from a folder
		onto the <i>Checker</i> window. Alternatively, choose the <b>File|Check Files</b>
		menu option to select one or more files using a file chooser.
	  <p>The files you add will be listed in the table at the top of the window.
		The progress of each file will be updated in the <b>Status</b> column
		as <i>Checker</i> works. <i>Checker</i> is actually more efficient when
		working on many files at once, so add as many files as you like.
	  <p><b>More Information:</b> <a href="files.html">Working with Files</a>
	  <h1>Interpreting the Results</h1>
	    Once a file has been checked, its <b>Status</b> message will change to
		one of <b>Passed</b>, <b>Passed with Warnings</b>, or <b>Failed</b>.
		For more information, click on the completed file's name in the file table.
		That file's reports will appear in the bottom section of the <i>Checker</i> window.
		There are two reports, which you switch between by clicking the appropriate tab.
		The <b>Validation</b> report describes any problems that were found.
		The <b>Information</b> report provides general technical
		information about the file.
	  <h1>Errors and Warnings</h1>
	    For each issue that <i>Checker</i> identifies, it will add an entry to
		the <b>Validation</b> report. The entry provides a brief description
		of the problem along with an icon. The icon identifies whether the
		issue is considered to be an error or a warning.
		Errors are marked with a red octagon icon; warnings are
		marked with a yellow triangle icon:

		<div align=center><table border=0 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0>
			<tr align=center><td><img src="../fail.png"><td><img src="../warn.png"></tr>
			<tr align=center><td>Error Icon<td>Warning Icon</tr>
		</table></div>

		<p>Files that contain errors will fail validation. You should not upload
		them until you fix the errors and the file passes. Files that contain
		warnings can still pass. However, it is still a good idea to fix the
		issue if you understand how.

		<p>When you first use <i>Checker</i>, it will be gentle in its
		assessments. This initial setting is best for new <i>LibriVox</i>
		contributors. As you gain more experience, you can
		<a href="gentle_vs_strict.html">ask <i>Checker</i> to be more
		strict</a> about which files it allows to pass.
	 <h1>Fixing Problems</h1>
	    If you are familiar with digital audio or you have read over the
		<a href="http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Newbie_Guide_to_Recording"><i>LibriVox</i> Wiki</a>,
		just reading the brief description in the <b>Validation</b> report may
		be enough that you know how to fix the problem. If not, first try clicking
		the <b>Help</b> link printed just after the description. This opens a
		short help page that describes the problem in more detail.
		If you still are not sure what to do, check the <i>LibriVox</i> Wiki
		and forums for help, or contact the project's book coordinator (BC) or meta
		coordinator (MC). Once you have fixed all of the issues and your file
		passes, you are ready to upload!
