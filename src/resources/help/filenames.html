	  <h1>LibriVox File Names</h1>
	     The file names used for project sections provide basic information
	     about the file ("metadata"). The file names must be consistent, to
		 make it easy for listeners to select all of the files for a project and
		 add them to a play list in the right order. When naming your files,
		 follow the convention established by the book coordinator (BC) for the
		 project. It usually looks like this:
	  <p align='center'><tt>book_title_01_lastname.mp3</tt>
	  <p>The <tt>book_title</tt> is taken from the name of the book, but it is
	     usually shortened. The number in the middle is the section number.
		 The part after the section number is the author's last name.
	  <p>In addition to following this convention, all file names should:
	  <ul>
		  <li> use only lowercase letters</li>
		  <li> not use any spaces (use "_" instead, but be careful not to double it)</li>
	  </ul>
	     On many keyboards, the underscore character (_) is typed by holding
		 shift and pressing the minus (-) key.
	  <h1>Leading Zeros in Section Numbers</h1>
	     Use leading zeroes to make all of the section numbers in a project the
	     same length. If a project has more than 10 sections (but less than 100),
	     then you would use 01 through 09 instead of 1 through 9.
	  <h1>Unsafe Characters</h1>
	     Some characters are not safe to use in file names because they are
	     not allowed to be used on some platforms. For maximum compatibility,
		 stick to just letters, numbers, underscores (_), and the period
	     that appears before the extension. (The extension is the <tt>.mp3</tt>
		 part of the file name. Depending on your operating system's settings,
		 this part of the name might be hidden.)
	  <h1>Matching the ID3 Tag</h1>
	     The information in the file name should correspond to the information
		 in the file's ID3 tag. To view the contents of the file's ID3 tags,
		 if any, click on the <b>Information</b> tab. Usually, you can edit the
		 ID3 information in your audio editing application before exporting the
		 MP3 file.
		 <p><b>Note:</b> The information in the file name likely won't match the ID3
		 tag exactly. <i>Checker</i> tries to match the information approximately,
		 but it is just a computer and it won't get things right every time.
		 Use your own judgement, and ask the BC for help if you are not sure.
