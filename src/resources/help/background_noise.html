	  <h1>Background Noise</h1>
	  Recorded audio contains background noise. The "silent" parts of the
	  recording are not really silent at all, but pick up all the sounds
	  from the ambient environment, such as your fridge running in the
	  next room, the hum of the electricity powering your recording device,
	  and even the birds chirping outside the window. Typically, background
	  noise is a persistent quiet hiss sound that can be heard throughout
	  the recording. This kind of noise is what <i>Checker</i> will test for
	  in your recording.

	  <p><i>Checker</i> measures background noise by looking at the quietest
	  part and measuring its volume. Since you should be leaving
	  several seconds of silence at the end of your recording,
	  <i>Checker</i> should be able to get a good sample of your
	  background noise level.

	  <p>If <i>Checker</i> finds that the background noise level is too high,
	  it will suggest applying noise cleaning. Depending on how high the noise
	  level is, this could either produce a warning or an error in your validation.
	  Try cleaning the audio (see below) and then re-check the file.

	  <h1>Reducing Background Noise</h1>
	  To reduce background noise while recording, turn the recording level down
	  on your recording device. (The recording level is how much the signal from
	  your microphone is amplified during recording.) If you
	  turn the gain down too much, then <a href="volume.html">your voice may be too quiet</a>,
	  so you will need to find a happy medium.

	  <p>After your recording is made, you can clean the remaining noise
	  using your audio editing application. However, too much cleaning
	  will add unpleasant artifacts to your recording. The best approach
	  is to do the best job you can by adjusting the recording level or moving
	  to a quieter part of the house, then clean up the little bit of noise
	  that's left in your editing software.
	  Good source recordings can generally
	  be cleaned down to a noise level between 24-28 dB without distortion.
	  That is more than clean enough for pleasant listening.
	  (Keep in mind that <i>Checker</i> isn't a person; it isn't smart enough
	  to know if your recording is starting to "sound weird" from too much cleaning.
	  Always listen to some of the speech after cleaning to make
	  sure it is still crisp and clear. If you don't like how it sounds, undo
	  and try again with less aggressive settings.)

	  <h1>Suspiciously Low Background Noise</h1>
	  <i>Checker</i> will report if your background noise level is suspiciously
	  low (zero or near zero). This may indicate that you have over-cleaned
	  the noise from the recording. Alternatively, it may mean that you have
	  inserted true silence into the recording by mistake (that is, a segment
	  with a constant zero amplitude). Note that when the instructions on
	  <i>LibriVox</i> ask you to leave 5 or 10 seconds of silence at the end
	  of the recording, this means that you should continue recording after
	  you have finished speaking. It does not mean that you should use an
	  "insert silence" command in your audio editing software.
