	  <h1>Volume</h1>
	  <i>Checker</i> tests how loud your recording will sound to the listener,
	  and it will tell you if this falls outside of <i>LibriVox</i>
	  guidelines. A recording's loudness roughly corresponds to the average height
	  of its <a href="waveform.html">waveform</a>.
	  (<i>Checker</i> uses a more complex method that better
	  models human hearing.)

	  <h1>Increasing Volume</h1>
	  If <i>Checker</i> tells you that your recording is too quiet or loud,
	  you can fix the problem using the free <i>MP3Gain</i> application.
	  The default settings of the this application will create files that
	  match the target volume for <i>LibriVox</i> files.

	  <p>When you amplify your recording, you also amplify the
	  <a href="background_noise.html">background noise</a>.
	  If the recording is very quiet, then
	  you won't be able to clean the noise without distorting the sound
	  of your voice. In this case, you may need to re-record after adjusting
	  your recording level.
