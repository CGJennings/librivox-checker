	  <h1>Waveform Viewer</h1>
	  The waveform viewer allows you to perform an on-the-spot visual
	  inspection of a file. Select the file to view in the
	  file table, and choose the <b>Tools|View Waveform</b> menu item.
	  <i>Checker</i> will open a new window and draw a visual representation
	  of the file's waveform. If the file has two channels (for example, if
	  it is stereo), then both channels are shown in a column.
	  Move the pointer over the waveform to locate a specific time in the
	  audio (the time is shown in the bottom right corner of the window).
