	  <h1>ID3 Tags</h1>
	  By itself, an MP3 file contains nothing but audio data. To allow your
	  media player to display information like the title and artist for an
	  MP3, extra information must be added to the file. This
	  extra information is called <i>metadata</i>. <i>LibriVox</i> uses a
	  particular method of adding metadata called an ID3 tag.

	  <p><b>More Information:</b> <a href="http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/What_is_ID3">LibriVox Wiki: What is ID3?</a>

	  <h1>Adding or Editing an ID3 Tag</h1>
	  Depending on your audio editing software, there is often an option to
	  set the ID3 metadata when you save the audio as an MP3. Your operating
	  system may also let you edit the metadata. In Windows,
	  you can do this by right clicking on the file,
	  choosing <b>Properties</b>, and then choosing the <b>Details</b> tab.
	  In OS X, you can right click on the file in <i>iTunes</i> and choose
	  <b>Get Info</b>.

	  <p><b>More Information:</b> <a href="http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/How_to_Add_or_Edit_ID3_Tags">LibriVox Wiki: How to Add or Edit ID3 Tags</a>

	  <h1>Required Metadata</h1>
	  For <i>LibriVox</i> files, you need to enter the Title, Album, and Artist fields
	  of your file's ID3 tag. Typically, these will be a description of the
	  section, the title of the book, and the book's author. The project
	  page will tell you the exact values to use for each field. It is important
	  to use these exactly as given so that the naming is consistent across
	  sections. Just copy and
	  paste the values for your section into the matching fields in your ID3
	  tag editor.

	  <p><b>Note:</b> The finished audio file will include more fields in the
	  ID3 tag than just the three above. These are added automatically when
	  the book is catalogued, so you don't need to worry about them.

	  <p><b>Tip:</b> When copying the value for one of the fields
	  from the project page, you may accidentally select a space before or
	  after the field value. <i>Checker</i> can warn you if one of the fields
	  contains leading or trailing spaces. (This may also indicate that you didn't
	  select quite enough, and part of the text is missing.)

	  <h1>ID3 Tag Versions (v1, v2, etc.)</h1>
	  There are different versions of the ID3 tag format. Version 1 (ID3 v1)
	  is considered obsolete. It supports only a few fields, and the number of
	  characters that can appear in each field is very limited.
	  Version 2 (ID3 v2) supports many more kinds of
	  fields, and has effectively no limit on field size.
	  Version 2 can also include cover art and other non-text
	  information. Although LibriVox files don't need any of the extra fields
	  in v2 files, they do benefit from the longer field lengths.

	  <p>Within ID3 v2, there are a number of of revisions (v2.00, 2.10, and so
	  on). Although all of these versions can hold similar kinds of information,
	  the way that they store that information varies. Of these, it is better to use version
	  v2.30 or v2.40, because these provide the best support for non-English
	  characters. Of the two, v2.30 is currently the best choice overall because it
	  is compatible with the widest range of software and players.

	  <p><i>Checker</i> can convert existing ID3 tags to ID3 v2.30 for you.
	  Select the files in question and choose <b>Tools|Convert ID3 Tags</b>.
	  Ensure that the <b>Convert to ID3 v2.3</b> button is selected, and then
	  click the <b>Convert</b> button.

	  <h1>Having Both Tag Versions in One File</h1>
	  It is possible to have both an ID3 v1 tag and an ID3 v2 tag in the same
	  file. This is a good idea in principle, because it allows very old players
	  that don't understand v2 tags to use the v1 tag instead. However, some
	  tools have the bad habit of only using the v2 tag if the v1 tag is missing.
	  Thus, when both tags are present, these tools use the <i>less</i> detailed tag.
	  Since most media players support v2.30 tags, it is therefore best
	  not to include a v1 tag in the file.

	  <p><i>Checker</i> can remove existing ID3 v1 tags for you. When using the
	  <b>Tools|Convert ID3 Tags</b> command, ensure that the option to remove
	  obsolete tags is checked before converting.

	  <h1>Viewing ID3 Tags in Checker</h1>
	  <i>Checker</i> will list the contents of any ID3 tags in your files
	  on the <b>Information</b> tab. For ID3 v2 tags, it only displays the most
	  common kinds of fields. If there is a cover image or other
	  artwork, this will be displayed as a thumbnail.
	  Clicking on the thumbnail will show the full size version of the image.
