	  <h1>ID3 Tag Editor</h1>
	  <i>Checker</i> can edit ID3 tags. There are a lot of good fully
	  fledged tag editing applications available, so <i>Checker</i>
	  doesn't try to replace them. It just provides the basics you need to
	  create and fix tags for <i>LibriVox</i> files on the spot.

	  <p>To edit ID3 tags, choose the file or files you wish to edit in the
	  file table and then choose the <b>Tools|Batch Edit ID3 Tags</b> menu
	  item. The editor window will open. This will display the most common ID3
	  fields (artist, title, album, track, year, genre, comments, and cover
	  art). Edit the fields and choose <b>Update</b> to modify the
	  selected file(s).

	  <p><b>Note:</b> The editor will modify <i>all the selected files</i>
	  in the file table. To help you remember this and avoid mistakes,
	  the <b>Update</b> button will show the number of files that will be
	  affected in brackets.

	  <h1>Limiting the Scope of Changes</h1>
	  When you are working on a batch of files, you usually only want to edit
	  a subset of the available fields. To control whether a field will be changed,
	  look for the check box to the field's left. If it is checked, then that field
	  will be updated when you save your changes. If it is unchecked, then it
	  will keep the value it had before. To emphasize this, unchecked fields
	  will be greyed out and you will not be able to edit them.

      <p>To change several check boxes quickly, you can click on
	  either the <b>Check All</b> or <b>Uncheck All</b> buttons along the
	  right edge of the window:

	  <p style="text-align: center"><img src="../checkall.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="../uncheckall.png">

	  <p>To save time, when you edit multiple files the title, track,
	  and comment fields will start out unchecked. If you open only one file,
	  everything starts out checked.

	  <h1>Adding and Removing Cover Art</h1>
	  Editing the cover art of the selected files is a breeze. If you want to
	  add or change the cover art, drag an image file (JPEG or PNG) from
	  a folder and drop it on the picture frame. It may take <i>Checker</i>
	  a couple of seconds to read in the file, but in a moment a thumbnail
	  of the new art will appear in the frame. To delete the existing cover
	  art, click on the small trash can icon next to the picture frame:

	  <p style="text-align: center"><img src="../delete.png">

	  <h1>Autofill</h1>
	  The only fields you need to fill in before uploading are the title,
	  artist, and album. However, <i>Checker</i> can also fill in
	  the year, track, and genre automatically as a convenience.
	  To turn this on, choose the <b>Autofill</b> button. (If you don't
	  fill the track and genre in, they will be added automatically
	  later on at <i>LibriVox</i>.)

	  <p>Note that when this option is on, the
	  displayed track number will be the track number of the active row
	  in the file table, but rest assured that every selected file will get its
	  own track number. The track number will be extracted from the title
	  field text, or from the file name if the title doesn't start with a number.

	  <h1>ID3 Version</h1>
	  The editor can save edited tags as either ID3 v2.3 or ID3 v2.4 using the
	  dropdown menu in the bottom-left corner. If you don't change this,
	  the tags will be saved as ID3 v2.3, which is the most widely supported
	  version.
