	  <h1>Track Length</h1>
	  A text is usually split into sections that are 10 to 40 minutes
	  long, to break them up into convenient-sized chunks for listening and
	  writing to CDs. There are some exceptions to this. For example, most
	  poems are shorter than 10 minutes, so this guideline would not apply.
	  If you need help deciding how to break up your file, or if you are not
	  sure if this guideline applies to your section, contact the book
	  coordinator (BC) for the project.
