	  <h1>Ambiguous Channel Layouts</h1>
	  This warning appears when different parts of the audio file report
	  that they use different channel arrangements. For example, if some
	  parts are mono and some parts are stereo. MP3 files are made of
	  lots of little tiny chunks of audio called frames. Each frame contains
	  basic information about the audio format, such as the sampling
	  frequency and type of channels to use. Generally speaking, a single
	  file should use the same channel layout in every frame. (The exception
	  is that different frames may switch freely between the "stereo"
	  and "joint stereo" layouts.)

	  <p>When a file contains different channel layouts for different frames,
	  it may indicate that the file is corrupt or that it was created by
	  concatenating several MP3 files together. In either case, it is usually
	  something you will want to investigate. When <i>Checker</i> detects this
	  situation, it will display a list of the different formats. For each
	  format, it will also display the number of frames that used the format.
