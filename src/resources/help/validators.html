	  <h1>Choosing Validation Methods</h1>
	  The various tests that checker performs are divided into a few
	  general categories. You can turn a category of tests on or off
	  by choosing the <b>Validation|Choose Validation Methods</b>
	  menu item and checking the categories to include.

	  <p>Although you will want to include all of the available tests most
	  of the time, sometimes it is helpful to be able to skip some.
	  For example, if you are only interested in checking ID3 tags, turning
	  off the other tests will allow you to do this very quickly.

      <p>To quickly clear or restore multiple categories, you can click on
	  either the <b>Check All</b> or <b>Uncheck All</b> buttons along the
	  right edge of the window:
