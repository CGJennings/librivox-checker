	  <h1>Audio Format</h1>
	  <i>LibriVox</i> uses a specific audio format for its files: mono sound,
	  44.1 Khz 16-bit audio, encoded in the MP3 format
	  at a constant 128 kbps bit rate. Although there are a lot of technical terms
	  there, you don't need to understand them to create valid files. All you
	  need to know is how to tell your audio editing software to use these
	  settings. See the Wiki article below for step-by-step help.
