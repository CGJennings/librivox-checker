	  <h1>Gentle versus Strict Validation</h1>
	  <i>Checker</i> provides two different levels of validation, called
	  <i>Gentle</i> and <i>Strict</i>. You can choose the level that you
	  wish to apply by choosing the appropriate item in the <b>Validation</b>
	  menu. A description of each level follows.

	  <h1>Gentle</h1>
	  Gentle validation is meant for new <i>LibriVox</i> contributors.
	  It is less intimidating because it raises less issues overall, and
	  treats fewer issues as errors.

	  <p>The general rule is that in gentle mode, an issue will only be
	  considered an error if:
	  <ol><li>the problem requires re-recording or re-encoding the audio
			  to fix, or
		  <li>it would be time-consuming for the book coordinator (BC) or
	          meta coordinator (MC) to fix the problem.</ol>

	  <p>Gentle validation also tends to be more forgiving
	  when it must make a judgement about a subjective quality of the audio.

	  <h1>Strict</h1>
	  Strict validation is meant for more experienced <i>LibriVox</i>
	  contributors. These users have the experience to fix most issues
	  themselves, thus reducing the workload for the BCs and MCs.
	  It is also meant for use by the BCs and MCs themselves, to help
	  them perform their final checks before signing off on a file.

	  <p>Overall, strict validation flags more issues as errors, and
	  reports more issues overall, than gentle mode. The general rule
	  is that if <i>Checker</i> is certain that the file does not meet
	  <i>LibriVox</i> standards, the issue is flagged as error.
	  If <i>Checker</i> is merely suspicious, the issue is flagged as a
	  warning.
