	  <h1>Working with Files</h1>
	  Using <i>Checker</i> consists of giving it MP3 files to check, waiting
	  for it to check them, and then interpreting the results.
	  This page describes the first of these steps: adding files to check and
	  managing the files that you have added.
	  <h1>The File Table</h1>
	  The <i>Checker</i> window is divided into two sections: the top section of the
	  window contains the table of files to be checked. The bottom part will
	  show the report for an individual file. There is a small bar across the
	  window between the two sections that you can drag up or down to change the
	  relative size of the two sections.

	  <p>The file table lists each file you've added in one column, and the
	  status of the file in another column. If you add a lot of files at once,
	  some of them will display <b>Waiting to Start</b>. These files are queued
	  up to be checked, and will get their turn once some of the other files
	  finish. Files that are currently being checked will display <b>Checking...</b>
	  and a progress bar that shows how far along they are. When the bar fills up,
	  the file is done and the status will change to summarize the result of the
	  test: either <b>Passed</b>, <b>Passed with Warnings</b>, <b>Failed</b>,
	  or (if something went wrong) <b>Error</b>.</p>

	  <p>To select a file, click anywhere on its row in the file table. When you
	  select a file, its report will appear in the report section below the file
	  table (if it is ready). Most of the commands available from the
	  <i>Checker</i> menu can be applied to a group of files all at once.
	  You can select a group of files by clicking the
	  first file in the group, holding <b>Shift</b>, and then clicking the last
	  file in the group. Alternatively, holding down <b>Ctrl</b> and clicking
	  on a file will add or remove it from the selection.

	  <h1>Adding Files to the File Table</h1>
	  There are a few ways to add new files to be checked. The easiest is often
	  to simply drag the files from their folder to the <i>Checker</i> window
	  and drop them. When you drag files over the window, the file table will
	  be outlined in blue to show that it will accept them.

	  <p>You can also add files by choosing the <b>File|Check Files</b>
	  menu item and selecting the files you wish to add. If the files are online,
	  you can choose <b>File|Check URLs</b> and enter the URL (Web address)
	  instead. When you use this option, the file will first be downloaded to
	  a temporary space on your computer. When you close <i>Checker</i>, these
	  temporary download files will be deleted. However, if you wish you can
	  keep a copy by selecting the desired file in the file
	  table and choosing <b>File|Save a Copy</b>.

	  <p>In addition to adding MP3 files directly, you can also drop ZIP archives
	  containing MP3s onto <i>Checker</i>. The MP3 files will be extracted to
	  temporary files (similar to the URL option above) and then checked.

	  <h1>Removing Files from the File Table</h1>
	  To remove one or more files from the file table, select them and then choose
	  the <b>Edit|Remove Files</b> menu item. You can remove a file at any time,
	  even if it is still being checked. To remove all files at once, choose
	  the <b>Edit|Remove All Files</b> menu item. If you are checking a large batch
	  of files and you are only interested in the ones that might have problems,
	  choosing <b>Edit|Remove Passed Files</b> will remove all the files that
	  have been checked and passed the testing process.

	  <h1>Playing a File</h1>
	  Double-clicking on a file in the file table will open it using your computer's
	  default program for opening MP3 files, which is usually your media player
	  application. (This feature may not work on some platforms.)
