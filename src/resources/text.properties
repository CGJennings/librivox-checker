                     The <i>checker</i> program is a first step in checking \
                     your audio file for problems. Although <i>checker</i> \

                     additional checks on the file after you upload it, and \

    then section numbers less than 10 should include a leading 0. For example, \
    section 3 would be 03 but section 28 would be 28. (Likewise, you would use \
    099 for a project with 100 sections or more, and so on.)
fv-must-not-use-incompatible-chars = The following characters should be avoided \
    in file names because they cause problems on some computer platforms: \
